Imagine you are a data analyst working for a marketing agency based in San Francisco. 
The marketing agency wants to contact local boba tea shops to inquire about a potential collaboration for a new marketing campaign. 
The agency plans to visit the top-rated shops within a 10-mile radius of the center of their target area. 
To assist with planning, the agency asks your team to review external data related to ratings and locations of boba tea shops in San Francisco. 
One of your teammates has created a spreadsheet from an online source. However, the data is not in the greatest shape.

Your assignment is to identify the dirty elements in the dataset and clean them up. 
By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to identify dirty elements in a dataset, remove duplicate data, and use the COUNTIF and SPLIT functions to help clean data.
